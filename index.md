Robot



## Biography:

My name is Hong-
Yi Liu (Paul). graduate from NTU IE which my thesis is about anomaly detection
and diagnosis of the industrial robot arm. I do stick to innovative, integrity and
communication. I majored in economics that concedes how individuals interact
with each other under the scarcity of resources. I worked for a plastic injection
manufacturer for a period of time and acquired lean production know-how, PDCA,
and DMAIC skills since graduated from national Chung Cheng Economics.
Luckily, I was admitted to NTU Industrial Engineering subsequently. I assist the
joint commission of Taiwan (JCT) that hands-on with Healthcare Quality
Improvement Campaign during summer vacation. My advisor Prof. Huang (黃漢

邦) assigned me a project about humanoid robot arm anomaly detection and

spectrum analysis with multivariate statistical process control for predictive
maintenance. Focus on analyzing the performance metrics of an industrial robotic
arm with ISO 9283 studies. The fault diagnosis system is consequently
implemented and build up a prognosis model. After graduation, I took my career
in Quanta computer as an IQC engineer. Mainly Four types works we handle
including :

1. Handling material incoming and production line issue, confirming the
improvement effect from vendor. Investiage Capability process ratio among
multiple raw material.
2. Define inspection items for NPI material & the first incoming, carry inspector to
do inspection and tracking new build status. Meanwhile, Establish the standard
inspection progress for material.
3. Supplier management :Urging suppliers sorting/rework while the defects were
found. 4. Participate the NPI/routine meeting with a variety of BU, kinds of model.
And maintain equip/fixture for ISO auditory.
In retrospect, these experiences have been a great teacher. I have acquired
patience, consistent effort, planning, perseverance and observation due to my
long-term habit.
